# Image tools

Whole-image operations for photographs and frames: edge-aware smoothing, denoising, local
contrast, colour transfer and haze removal. Each family is one function with a method
enum and a parameter struct, so a new method joins its family without a new entry point.
The parameter structs follow one rule: a zero field reads as that method's default, and a
NULL pointer is every default. Every method is held to a reference implementation by a
test suite, named with the method below.

## Edge-aware smoothing

```c
typedef enum {
    ALWAN_EDGE_FILTER_GUIDED = 0,
    ALWAN_EDGE_FILTER_JOINT_BILATERAL = 1,
    ALWAN_EDGE_FILTER_ROLLING_GUIDANCE = 2,
    ALWAN_EDGE_FILTER_DOMAIN_TRANSFORM_NC = 3,
    ALWAN_EDGE_FILTER_DOMAIN_TRANSFORM_RF = 4,
    ALWAN_EDGE_FILTER_FAST_GLOBAL_SMOOTHER = 5
} alwan_edge_filter_method;

alwan_status alwan_edge_filter_{T}(alwan_{T} *out, size_t out_row_stride,
                                   alwan_{T} const *src, size_t src_row_stride, size_t src_channels,
                                   alwan_{T} const *guide, size_t guide_row_stride, size_t guide_channels,
                                   size_t width, size_t height,
                                   alwan_edge_filter_method method,
                                   alwan_edge_filter_params_{T} const *params);
```

Each method smooths `src` while keeping the edges of a guide image: the base layer of a
base-and-detail edit, a matte or mask snapped to a picture's edges, or a no-flash photograph
denoised along a flash photograph's edges. `guide` NULL uses `src` as its own guide.
`src` has 1 to 4 channels and the guide 1 to 4 (1 or 3 for `GUIDED`); `out` has `src`'s
layout and may be `src`.

| Field of `alwan_edge_filter_params_{T}` | Methods | 0 reads as |
|---|---|---|
| `radius` | `GUIDED`, `JOINT_BILATERAL`, `ROLLING_GUIDANCE` | 4 for `GUIDED`, `round(1.5 sigma_space)` for the others |
| `eps` | `GUIDED` | 0.01 |
| `sigma_color` | `JOINT_BILATERAL`, `ROLLING_GUIDANCE` / `DOMAIN_TRANSFORM_*` / `FAST_GLOBAL_SMOOTHER` | 0.1 / 0.4 / 0.03 |
| `sigma_space` | `JOINT_BILATERAL`, `ROLLING_GUIDANCE` / `DOMAIN_TRANSFORM_*` | 3 / 60 |
| `lambda` | `FAST_GLOBAL_SMOOTHER` | 900 |
| `lambda_attenuation` | `FAST_GLOBAL_SMOOTHER` | 0.25 |
| `iterations` | `ROLLING_GUIDANCE` / `DOMAIN_TRANSFORM_*`, `FAST_GLOBAL_SMOOTHER` | 4 / 3 |
| `start_from_source` | `ROLLING_GUIDANCE` | 0: start from the source's Gaussian (the paper) |

The defaults are each paper's settings for values in 0..1.

### `GUIDED`

He, Sun and Tang (ECCV 2010, TPAMI 2013): in every window of side `2 radius + 1` the
output is a linear function of the guide, `q = a . I + b`, with `a` and `b` fitted to `src`
by least squares with ridge `eps` and then averaged over the windows covering each pixel.
The image as its own guide smooths within regions and keeps edges; a colour guide with a
one-channel source (a matte, a haze transmission map, a mask from `alwan_select_*`) snaps
the source to the guide's edges. The cost does not depend on the radius. `eps` is in the
square of the guide's units: for a guide in 0..1, 1e-3 keeps fine edges and 0.1 smooths
strongly.

It follows OpenCV's `ximgproc::guidedFilter`: box means with the border reflected (the
edge pixel repeated), the colour guide's 3 x 3 covariance inverted by cofactors, and, for
`eps` below 0.01, a determinant under 1e-6 replaced by 1. It computes in double. Suite
190: the colour-guide cases agree with OpenCV to 1.8e-7, float rounding; the grey-guide
case to 6.1e-6, because OpenCV's SSE build takes the reciprocal of the variance with a
12-bit approximation.

### `JOINT_BILATERAL`

The bilateral filter (Tomasi and Manduchi 1998) with its range weight taken from the guide
(the joint image of Petschnigg et al. and Eisemann and Durand, 2004): each output is a mean
of `src` over a disc of `radius`, weighted by distance (`sigma_space`) and by how close the
guide's value there is to its value at the centre (`sigma_color`). With `src` as its own
guide it is the ordinary bilateral filter. The colour distance is the L1 sum of channel
differences, the window a disc and the border reflected without repeating the edge pixel,
as in OpenCV's `ximgproc::jointBilateralFilter`; the colour Gaussian is evaluated exactly
where OpenCV reads a 4096-bin table, and a flat guide is not replaced by a square Gaussian
blur as OpenCV does. Cost grows with the square of the radius. Suite 194 agrees with OpenCV
to 4.8e-7.

### `ROLLING_GUIDANCE`

Zhang, Shen, Xu and Jia (ECCV 2014): the joint bilateral filter iterated with its own last
output as the guide; `guide` is not read. Starting from the source's Gaussian (the paper,
`start_from_source` 0), structures smaller than `sigma_space` are removed first and the
iterations then bring the large edges back, a scale-aware smoother that keeps the outlines
of what it keeps. OpenCV's `ximgproc::rollingGuidanceFilter` starts from the source itself
(`start_from_source` non-zero), which keeps small structures that the paper's start
removes; suite 194 holds that start to OpenCV to 7.7e-7 over four iterations and checks
the paper's first step is the constant-guide filter.

### `DOMAIN_TRANSFORM_NC`, `DOMAIN_TRANSFORM_RF`

Gastal and Oliveira (SIGGRAPH 2011) replace a 2D edge-aware filter with 1D filters along
rows and columns in a transformed coordinate: each step between neighbours is
`1 + sigma_space / sigma_color * |guide difference|` (L1 over the guide's channels) long,
so an edge in the guide becomes a long gap that the 1D filter barely crosses. Rows and
columns alternate `iterations` times with a shrinking spatial sigma, which removes the
stripes a single pass leaves. The cost does not depend on `sigma_space`. `NC`
(normalized convolution) averages a box in the transformed coordinate; `RF` (recursive
filtering) runs a first-order recursive filter forward and back, which leaks further
across weak edges and costs less. The interpolated-convolution mode of the paper is not
offered.

It follows OpenCV's `ximgproc::dtFilter`: the transformed coordinate is built in float as
OpenCV builds it, so NC boxes hold the same pixels, and the data is filtered in double.
Suite 195 agrees with OpenCV to 1.9e-6 in NC (OpenCV's float running sum) and 1.5e-7 in RF,
along a colour and a one-channel guide. `sigma_space` below 1 or `sigma_color` below 0.01
returns `ALWAN_E_RANGE` where OpenCV clamps silently; `iterations` runs from 1 to 30.

### `FAST_GLOBAL_SMOOTHER`

Min, Choi, Lu, Ham, Sohn and Do (IEEE TIP 2014) solve the weighted least squares smoother,
`sum (u - f)^2 + lambda sum w_pq (u_p - u_q)^2` with `w_pq = exp(-|g_p - g_q| / sigma_color)`,
as exact 1D problems along every row and then every column. Each is tridiagonal and costs
one forward and one backward sweep. Where the filters above average a window, this one
solves for the whole line at once, so a region bounded by guide edges flattens however
large it is. Larger `lambda` smooths further; `iterations` repeat the row and column passes
with `lambda` multiplied by `lambda_attenuation` each time.

`|g_p - g_q|` is Euclidean over the guide's channels and `sigma_color` is in the guide's
units. OpenCV's `ximgproc::fastGlobalSmootherFilter` takes an 8-bit guide and
`sigma_color` in 0..255 steps; divide both by 255 to use its numbers with a guide in 0..1.
Suite 196 does that and agrees with OpenCV to 7.8e-6 at `lambda` 1000 and 4.5e-7 at
`lambda` 10, the difference being OpenCV's float solve; a constant source stays constant to
1e-14.
